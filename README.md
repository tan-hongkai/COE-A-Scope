### Overview
COE-A-Scope is an interactive data visualization project that analyzes Singaporeâ€™s Category A Certificate of Entitlement (COE) premiums. Through dynamic charts, users can explore trends in COE premiums, quotas, and bid ratios for different bidding rounds over time.

### Problem Statement
COE-A-Scope aims to visualize and provide insights into the fluctuations of COE premiums in Singapore. With a 10-year cycle of COE renewals, the app allows users to investigate how quotas and bidding rounds influence COE prices over time. By presenting historical data and offering comparisons between bidding rounds, users gain a clearer understanding of these dynamics.

### Business Value Proposition
COE-A-Scope provides stakeholders, such as car buyers, dealerships, and policymakers, with valuable insights into COE trends, helping them make informed decisions about vehicle purchases and market strategies. The app offers:

- A deeper understanding of COE cycles and the factors that drive premium increases or decreases.

- Enhanced visibility into bidding dynamics, allowing users to optimize their bids based on historical patterns.

### What I Learned
1. Data visualization using Altair to create interactive charts and overlays.

2. Handling time series data and adjusting for inflation in pricing analysis.

3. Incorporating user inputs through interactive elements like sliders and multiselect filters to refine data exploration in streamlit.
